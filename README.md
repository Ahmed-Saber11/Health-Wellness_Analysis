# Healthcare  Dataset Analysis

## bout the Dataset
This dataset contains personal and health-related information such as  sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, stress level, BMI and whether the person has a sleep disorder.  
The goal is to explore these factors and identify what influences sleep quality and disorders.

##  Tools Used
- Python for data cleaning and analysis:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical processing
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizing patterns and relationships

- Power BI for building a fully interactive dashboard to summarize insights and highlight key metrics.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed null values and fixed inconsistent data entries
- Converted data types (e.g., age as numeric, categorized jobs and BMI)
- Created new columns such as **age groups**

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the relationship between stress level and sleep quality
- Examined job types and their effect on average sleep duration*
- Compared sleep disorder rates across  genders and age groups 
- Investigated whether  physical activity  affects  sleep quality 
- Used scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to visualize key relationships

### 3. Requirements Identification
The analysis helped in identifying important requirements:
- Understanding what factors lead to sleep disorders
- Prioritizing high-risk groups (e.g., jobs with poor sleep)
- Recommending lifestyle improvements (more steps, lower stress, better physical activity)

### 4. Dashboard Creation
A detailed Power BI dashboard was created to display:
- Sleep disorder statistics
- Stress & heart rate metrics
- Sleep quality by age, gender, job, and more

##  Conclusion
The combination of Python and Power BI provided a full pipeline from data wrangling to business reporting. 
This project shows how health-related data can be analyzed to support wellness and preventative healthcare strategies.
